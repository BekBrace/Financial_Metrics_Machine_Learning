    "Any company in one point has to make investment decisions in its life. \n",
    "Investment decisions: are the firmâ€™s decision to invest its funds, most efficiently, into long-term assets. The firms do so because it expects the investment to provide them with some benefits over a single or a series of years.\n",
    "Decisions like launching an advertisement campaign or a R&D program have serious implications on the firm because they involve huge money. Therefore,  a firm must decide on its investment only after properly evaluating it. \n",
    "And that is why we are going to discuss four financial terms used for evaluation an investment a project that the company is considering.\n",
    "A- NPV (Net Present Value): NPV is a financial metric that calculates the present value of future cash flows generated by an investment or project. It takes into account the time value of money by discounting the cash flows to their present value. A positive NPV indicates that the investment is expected to generate more cash inflows than the initial investment and is generally considered favorable. [$ 29087 ]\n",
    "B- IRR (Internal Rate of Return): IRR is a financial metric used to evaluate the profitability of an investment or project. It is the discount rate at which the present value of the investment's cash inflows equals its initial cost. In other words, it represents the rate of return that makes the net present value of the investment zero. A higher IRR is generally preferred as it indicates a more attractive investment opportunity.\n",
    "C- Payback Period: Payback Period is a simple financial metric that measures the time required for an investment to generate cash flows sufficient to recover the initial investment cost. It indicates how long it takes to \"pay back\" the investment. Generally, a shorter payback period is desirable as it implies a quicker return on investment. However, it doesn't consider the time value of money and doesn't provide a comprehensive measure of profitability.\n",
    "PI (Profitability Index): PI, also known as the Profit Investment Ratio (PIR) or Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR), is a financial metric used to assess the profitability of an investment. It is calculated by dividing the present value of cash inflows by the present value of cash outflows. A PI greater than 1 indicates that the project is expected to generate positive value and is considered financially viable. The higher the PI, the more attractive the investment opportunity.\n",
    "Juste  note here that these explanations provide a basic understanding of the terms. But In practice and in real world, it's important to consider other factors and use these metrics in conjunction with other financial analyses to make informed investment decisions."
